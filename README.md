## SMITH 2 

[the sequel to Smith](https://github.com/dylanlanigansmith/smith)

SDL3 GPU this time. because why would I want a personal project to use well documented libraries?

todo:
- learn more about sdl3 gpu and modern gfx pipelines
- investigate sdl net 
- decide if we want to use [this](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) (instead of usual machoism i'll write it myself vibe)


### Setup
- project setup for vscode w/ cmake extension
- otherwise standard, `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)` should work

**MacOS**
- [install Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.4.309.0/mac/getting_started.html) for SDL Shadercross
- build
